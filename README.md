## Favorite Lines

> *‚ÄúYou are all the colors in one, at full brightness.‚Äù*


> *‚ÄúYou saved my life. Why couldn't I save yours?‚Äù*


> *‚ÄúListen, I‚Äôm the freak. I‚Äôm the weirdo. I‚Äôm the troublemaker. I start fights. I let people down. Don‚Äôt make Finch mad, whatever you do. Oh, there he goes again, in one of his moods. Moody Finch. Angry Finch. Unpredictable Finch. Crazy Finch. But I‚Äôm not a compilation of symptoms. Not a casualty of shitty parents and an even shittier chemical makeup. Not a problem. Not a diagnosis. Not an illness. Not something to be rescued. I‚Äôm a person.‚Äù*


> *‚ÄúI should be happy, but instead I feel nothing. I feel a lot of nothing these days. I've cried a few times, but mostly I'm empty, as if whatever makes me feel and hurt and laugh and love has been surgically removed, leaving me hollowed out like a shell.‚Äù*
